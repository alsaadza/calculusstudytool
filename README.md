## Calc 2 Study Tool

Disclaimer: this is still in beta mode so there's still a lot of bugs.

In integration practice, it would only accept one form of the answer as the tool couldnt check for equation equivalence. This will change soon

there are three options: Integral Practice, Series Practice, and Sequence Practice. This was made in Javascript, CSS, and HTML.**
